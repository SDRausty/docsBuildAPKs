### Really Easily Build an Android APK on an Android Device (Smartphone or Tablet).

Install [Termux](https://termux.com/) on Android. Copy and paste each of the following commands separately into [Termux.](https://termux.com/) 

Run each of the following command lines separately. Running them all at once may generate errors; Hint, copy and paste the following: 

```
pkg up
pkg install aapt apksigner dx ecj findutils git
cd && git clone https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs
./buildAPKs/scripts/build/buildMyFirstAPKs.sh

```

It may take some time, dependent on system speed and configuration, for these command-line commands to complete. This means packages will probably be installed in [Termux.](https://termux.com/) 

Then one of the programs from the git package, in particular `git` will fetch the buildAPKs repository from [Github,](https://github.com) and then the last command. While it should be fairly self-explanatory, it builds one of the APKs in the showcase; And places it in the Downloads folder using the tools that we have at our disposal today, in [Termux,](https://termux.com/) on-the-fly!

Upon completion, output as follows will print onto the screen:


```
Your moon.apk was copied to /sdcard/Download/moon.apk
It is ready to be installed.
Install moon.apk from /sdcard/Download/ using your file manager from Android.
```

After you're done installing your first APK from the downloads directory (File Manager > Download (**Tap moon.apk with your finger to install**)). You can build hundreds of other exciting, amazing and beautiful APKs by running [shell scripts](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/build) from the [sources directory.](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/sources)

These [shell scripts](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/build) will download the necessary components from [Github,](https://github.com) build them on device. Then, these [shell scripts](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/build) will deposit your built APKs into `/sdcard/Download/builtAPKs` on your device (smartphone or tablet). Like magic! Presto! 

Prefix these bash scripts by typing dot slash `./` in the [sources directory](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/sources)  on your smartphone or tablet in Termux, i.e. type `./b` at the prompt ($), press TAB TAB (x2). 

The prompt should magically add `uild`; Then add a capitol `A` and small `l`. Press TAB TAB (x2) again. This will build the following command on the command line `./buildAll.sh` for you. Press enter (return) in `~/buildAPKs/sources/` and watch as hundreds of APKs build on device...

Your built APKs will be deposited into `/sdcard/Download/builtAPKs` for installing onto your smartphone or tablet through your file manager. Have fun and enjoy compiling and running these select APKs!

#### When you press and momentarily hold the `volumeDown+power` buttons simultaneously on a smartphone, it takes a screenshot much like this one which shows the screen and the [the source code for this page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/master/docs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice.md) in [vim](http://www.vim.org/git.php) running on [Termux](./pages/asac) on [Android.](https://source.android.com/)
