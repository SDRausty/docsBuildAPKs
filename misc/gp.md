Have you ever wanted to build your own Android application? Your own APK? Now you can easily compile these selected applications that have already been successfully built and installed on a smartphone. Would you dare to try to spend some time learning something new to do so?

https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice

There are some Android apps which build quit well on device with the tools we have at our disposal in Termux today! Some of these showcased apps are quite complex. Others are very entertaining. While others are very simple, mere fragments of apps that are complete in themselves.

A new repository at https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs is open with instructions at https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/ and scripts https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/tree/master/scripts/build that build Android apps on devicei (a smartphone or tablet) in Termux.

Enjoy this project! Your feedback is welcome at either the wiki at https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/wiki the issues pages at https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/issues or through the code itself using `git` of course at https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/pulls
