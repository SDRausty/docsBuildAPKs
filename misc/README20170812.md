This project contains [source code](./sources) and [scripts](./scripts/build) to build APKs (Android Package Kits) on the [Termux](https://termux.com/) Android application. Quick setup instructions can be found at https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/setup

**Cloning with `git` and updating the submodules was automated into the build\* shell scripts on 20170812. Please use `git pull` to update buildAPKs.** 

**UPDATE: Cloning with git:**  This repository uses [submodules.](https://gist.github.com/gitaarik/8735255) In order to get **all the parts** of this project you will need to run [`git submodule init`](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/blob/master/scripts/maintenance/pullBuildAPKsSubmodulesInit.sh) when you clone and [`git submodule update`](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/blob/master/scripts/maintenance/pullBuildAPKsSubmodules.sh) to update all the submodules. If you only want to populate a particular submodule use `git submodule update pathToSubmodule`, i.e. `git submodule update source/widgets` will clone the widgets submodule into buildAPKs. The following command [`cat .gitmodules`](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs/blob/master/.gitmodules) displays which submodules are available and the paths to the submodules. Please remember to use [`git pull`,](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/) and these other commands to keep your repository of buildAPKs and the submodules up-to-date.

Build Android APKs on device (smartphone or tablet).
===========================================
Build Android APKs on device, on your smartphone or tablet with Termux; Make applications for your Android smartphone or tablet! This repository contains source code for various Android applications that have been successfully built in Termux.

Have you ever wanted to build your own application? Something that you can distribute over the Internet, and can be used on Android smartphones and tablets worldwide. Would you dare to try to spend some time learning something new to do so?

[BuildAPKs](https://github.com/sdrausty/buildAPKs) is a repository of source code designed just for this purpose. Source code is the way programs are written in a human understandable language for applications to compile and then to be run on an Android device. These programs have been tested and were built successfully on device, a smartphone. First successful builds on Sun May 28 2017 in Termux (Android 6.0.1 aarch64).

See https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs/reallyEasilyBuildAndroidAPKsOnDevice for quick setup instructions or https://sdrausty.github.io/buildAPKs for the website for this project.
